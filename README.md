# Data Analysis Portfolio
## Introduction
Hello!

Welcome to my Data Analyst Project Portfolio! 

I am a data analyst with experience using real-time data to foster informative decisions based on patterns and trends. I am proficient in Python, SQL, Excel, and PowerBI while currently learning Tableau and polishing off my skills in Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib.

Below, I will showcase projects that display my data analysis skills and my process of extracting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the datasets.

## CSULB Student Review's Sentiment Analysis
### Summary

The goal of this project was to extract all reviews of professors at California State University Long Beach from 1999-2023 and find out which attributes (grade, quality rating, etc.) correlated to positive or negative student reviews analyzed by each college. After the reviews were collected and the dataset was cleaned, sentiment analysis was performed on each review to classify each review as negative, neutral, or positive. Conclusions and visualizations were created which I will expand in more detail about the complete process below.

After producing line plots and box plots with t-tests, I found that for some colleges (not all our shown below) there is a relationship between COVID and online courses and lower reviews of quality and more negative reviews.
